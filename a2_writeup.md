# Assignment 2 - Write UP

## Description
This assignment is about learning and applying the while loop and iterating through multiple lists at a time.  We also will discuss how we match things in chatbots in order to extract what a user is trying to find.  Next assignment we will work with data bases and how we can extract information from them.

## What to complete
1. Go through the notes.py file w/ Mr. Berg
2. Complete `a2.py`, Mr. Berg will walk everyone through the process
3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below
5. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?

I thought the logic itself was just very confusing to understand.
It wasn't particularly hard to implement once I understood things, but the actual task was just very convoluted.

2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.

Since the function more or less returns key words/phrases about what the user wants, they can be piped into another function that can pull from a database when given the right keys.
